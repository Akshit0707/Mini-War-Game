# War Strategy — Modern Battlefield (Polished, MNC-ready demo)

This project is a polished, production-feel mini-game demo built with React + Canvas.
Theme: **Modern Battlefield** (tanks, soldiers, artillery). Features:
- Grid-based A* pathfinding
- Formations: Line, Wedge, Column
- Upgrades & economy (credits, buy unit upgrades)
- Mini-map, HUD, animated UI panels, particle effects
- Performance-minded game loop, modular code, and ready-to-push repo

## How to run locally
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## To publish to GitHub
1. `git init`
2. `git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit — modern battlefield demo"`
3. Create a repo on GitHub and follow instructions to push (or run):
   `git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/war-strategy-modern-mnc.git`
   `git push -u origin main`

## Notes
- All assets are simple vector/sprite-like shapes so the demo is lightweight.
- If you want actual tank/vehicle sprites, I can add an `assets/` folder with PNGs and update the code.
- I can also create the GitHub repo for you if you provide access or a repo name and token.
